## [Unreleased]

### Added
- *(connectivity)* **ALGO-CC-002**: strongly connected components
  (`strongly_connected_components`). Returns the same
  `ConnectedComponents { membership, count }` shape as weak components.
  Counterpart of
  `igraph_connected_components(_, _, _, _, IGRAPH_STRONG)` from
  `references/igraph/src/connectivity/components.c:203-386` —
  iterative two-pass Kosaraju (forward DFS → post-order; reverse via
  in-edges → SCCs). Membership labels match
  `python-igraph.connected_components(mode='strong')` exactly because
  both implementations follow Kosaraju's natural grandfather-pop order.
  Undirected graphs delegate to `connected_components` (their SCCs equal
  their WCCs). Full 9-step SOP: 11 unit tests, 2 oracle tests
  (two-disjoint-3-cycles + cycle-with-tail), 4 three-source conformance
  fixtures (igraph C: components.c two-3-cycles + directed-2-path;
  python-igraph: directed-4cycle-with-tail; R-igraph: test-components.R
  literal-graph A→B→C→A→D, isolate E), 2 proptest invariants (dense
  ids; SCC partition refines the underlying weak components), criterion
  baseline ≈ 4.49 µs on karate-as-directed, 2.44 µs on karate-undirected
  (delegate path), ≈ 86 ns/vertex on directed cycles up to n=10000.
- *(test-helper)* `tests/common/mod.rs::GraphPayload::from_graph` now
  honours `g.is_directed()` and reconstructs directed edge lists via
  out-neighbours (was hardcoded `directed=false`, dropping reverse
  edges). Caught by SCC's first oracle run.
- *(core)* internal helpers `Graph::out_neighbors_vec(v)` /
  `Graph::in_neighbors_vec(v)` (`pub(crate)`) used by direction-aware
  algorithms. Public mode-aware `neighbors(_, mode)` ships in a future
  AWU.

- *(connectivity)* **ALGO-CC-001**: weakly connected components
  (`connected_components`). Returns `ConnectedComponents { membership,
  count }`. Counterpart of
  `igraph_connected_components(_, _, _, _, IGRAPH_WEAK)` —
  BFS-based per-component scan, dense ids assigned in vertex-id order.
  Full 9-step SOP: 7 unit tests (empty / isolated / path / disjoint /
  self-loop / directed-weak / dense-ids invariant), 2 oracle tests
  against python-igraph (karate single component, two-disjoint), 4
  three-source conformance fixtures (igraph C: 2 isolated + path-5;
  python-igraph: two K3 cliques; R-igraph: two K5 cliques from
  test-components.R), 2 proptest invariants
  (membership length + dense ids; CC component of vertex 0 == BFS
  reachable set), criterion baseline ≈ 4.1 µs on karate.

- *(test-helpers)* `tests/conformance.rs::run_conformance` now takes
  a `serde_json::Value` for both `actual` and `expected` so non-list
  result shapes compare structurally. The previous BFS/DFS Vec<u32>
  shape is wrapped via `serde_json::json!(order)` in the per-test
  closure. CC is the first AWU with `{membership, count}` result.

- *(traversal)* **ALGO-TR-002**: depth-first search (`dfs`). Pre-order
  visit, single root, reachable component only. Counterpart of
  `igraph_dfs()` in `references/igraph/src/graph/visitors.c:479`. Full
  9-step AWU SOP run: 7 unit tests, 2 oracle tests against
  python-igraph 0.11.x (synthetic 4-node + karate full match), 3-source
  conformance (igraph C kary_tree(20,2) / python-igraph testDFS
  Tree(10,2) / R-igraph make_star(3) directed), 2 proptest invariants
  (no-duplicate visit, BFS/DFS reach the same set), criterion baseline
  ≈ 1.84 µs on karate.
- *(core)* `Graph::neighbors(v)` now returns neighbours sorted
  ascending by id, matching upstream igraph's
  `igraph_neighbors(_, _, _, IGRAPH_ALL)` and python-igraph's
  `Graph.neighbors(v)`. Implementation: `rebuild_indexes` does a stable
  pair-sort `(from, to)` (was counting-sort by `from` only), and the
  undirected branch of `neighbors()` does a merge over the two
  pre-sorted sublists. Caught by the DFS oracle test on the synthetic
  4-vertex case during the AWU.
- *(test-helper)* `tests/conformance.rs::build_graph` now honours
  `payload.directed` (was always undirected). Caught by R's
  `make_star(3)` DFS fixture.
- *(core)* **ALGO-CORE-001b**: edge-id helpers and incident-edges query.
  `edge(eid)` / `edge_source(eid)` / `edge_target(eid)` / `edge_other(eid, vid)`
  / `incident(v)`. Counterparts of `igraph_edge` and the `IGRAPH_FROM` /
  `IGRAPH_TO` / `IGRAPH_OTHER` macros from `igraph_interface.h`, and a
  simplified `igraph_incident` (default `IGRAPH_LOOPS_TWICE` semantics
  matching `neighbors`). `IgraphError::EdgeOutOfRange` surfaces invalid
  edge ids; `edge_other` errors with `InvalidArgument` when the supplied
  vertex is not actually an endpoint. The full mode-aware `incident`
  (IGRAPH_IN / IGRAPH_OUT / IGRAPH_ALL) ships in a later AWU once
  algorithms need it.
- *(core)* **ALGO-CORE-001a**: real `Graph` (replaces the Phase-0 throwaway
  `Graph<u32>`). Indexed-edgelist storage matching upstream igraph's
  `igraph_t` (`from`/`to`/`oi`/`ii`/`os`/`is`). New surface: `Graph::new(n,
  directed)`, `is_directed()`. Phase-0 method signatures
  (`with_vertices` / `add_edge` / `add_edges` / `vcount` / `ecount` /
  `neighbors` / `degree`) preserved so existing callers compile unchanged.
- *(core)* `Graph` derives `Clone` (deep) and `Default`.
- *(core)* Phase-0 split for `igraph_t`: ALGO-CORE-001a..e tracked in
  `.codefuse/tracking/ALGORITHMS.md`. Subsequent AWUs add `incident`,
  edge-id helpers, deletion, edge-list queries, and the property cache.

### Changed
- *(core)* `Graph::neighbors(v)` now returns `Vec<VertexId>` instead of
  `&[VertexId]`. The indexed-edgelist backend cannot offer a contiguous
  slice cheaply (out-neighbours live in `to[oi[os[v]..os[v+1]]]`).
  Iteration call sites no longer use the `&w` pattern; `for w in
  graph.neighbors(v)?` is the new shape. Affects `bfs` and the test
  helper in `tests/common/mod.rs`.
- *(core)* `Graph::degree(v)` for undirected graphs now counts
  self-loops as 2 (matching upstream `IGRAPH_LOOPS_TWICE` default at
  `type_indexededgelist.c:1162`). Phase-0 counted them as 1.
- *(test-helper)* `tests/common/mod.rs::GraphPayload::from_graph`
  rebuilds the edge list from `neighbors()` correctly when self-loops are
  present (was correct before only because `Graph::neighbors` returned a
  single entry per self-loop; the new backend reports 2).
- *(documentation)* `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog 1.1.0).
- *(documentation)* `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting via GitHub
  Security Advisory or email. Slim, alpha-appropriate scope.
- *(documentation)* `DEVELOPMENT.md` — maintainer + AI-agent setup notes
  (renamed from the original `CONTRIBUTING.md`, which was honestly never
  an external-contributor guide).
- *(documentation)* New minimal `CONTRIBUTING.md` — "alpha; not accepting
  external PRs yet; here is when that opens up".
- *(tooling)* `.editorconfig` — cross-IDE consistency for files cargo fmt
  does not touch (md / yml / toml / py / sh).
- *(ci)* `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly cargo + GitHub Actions + pip
  updates; minor/patch grouped, breaking changes split.
- *(documentation)* README badges: crates.io / docs.rs / CI / license / MSRV.

### Changed
- *(claude-code)* `.claude/settings.json` is committed again (Anthropic's
  intended pattern). The `.sample` workaround attempted earlier is
  removed; the `.githooks/pre-commit` hook is the safety net against
  accidental personal-grant commits.
- *(claude-code)* `.githooks/pre-commit` output bug fixed (entries with
  spaces no longer split into multiple "lines"); reference now points to
  DEVELOPMENT.md.

### Explicitly deferred
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CITATION.cff`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`,
  `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `SUPPORT.md`. These artifacts presume an external
  community / academic citations / multiple reviewers; none of those
  exist at 0.0.1-alpha.0. Add when the corresponding signal arrives.


## [0.0.1-alpha.0] — 2026-05-15

First publish to crates.io. Reserves the `rust-igraph` name and exercises
the release pipeline end-to-end.

### Added
- Walking-skeleton public surface:
  - `Graph` (undirected, unweighted, `u32` vertex ids, adjacency-list
    backed; Phase-0 minimal port of `igraph_t`)
  - `read_edgelist` (Phase-0 port of `igraph_read_graph_edgelist`)
  - `bfs` (single-root variant of `igraph_bfs`)
  - `IgraphError` + `IgraphResult` (initial 8 variants)
- Three-source conformance suite for BFS:
  - igraph C: 2 fixtures (path-10, kary_tree-20-2)
  - python-igraph: 1 fixture (Tree-10-2)
  - R-igraph: 1 fixture (ring-10)
- Live oracle test against python-igraph 0.11.x (BFS on Karate matches
  exactly).
- Property tests (proptest): no-duplicate-visit + reachability symmetry.
- Criterion bench: BFS on Karate ≈ 693 ns.
- mdBook scaffold; rustdoc auto-published to GitHub Pages on every push
  to `main`.
- `examples/bfs_karate.rs` smoke demo.
- AI-engineering scaffolding (committed): `CLAUDE.md`, 7 sub-agents under
  `.claude/agents/`, 9 skills under `.claude/skills/` (the `/awu-*`
  family + `/oracle-add` + `/phase-checkpoint` + `/resume-session`),
  3 hooks under `.claude/hooks/` (block-dangerous-git, post-edit-rust,
  post-tool-bash), prompt cookbook in `.codefuse/tracking/AI_PROMPTS.md`.
- AWU SOP infrastructure: 4 templates (`templates/{algo,test,oracle,bench}.{rs,py}.tpl`),
  ALGORITHMS / ARCHITECTURE / CONFORMANCE / RESUME tracking under
  `.codefuse/tracking/`.
- CI matrix: fmt + clippy (stable + MSRV 1.85) + test (stable on
  Linux/macOS, beta on Linux) + conformance + oracle + proptest +
  cargo-deny + wasm32 check + rustdoc -D warnings + GitHub Pages deploy +
  release workflow (tag-triggered cargo publish).

### Status
- API: alpha. WILL break before 0.1.0.
- 850-API parity: ~0% (only `Graph`, `read_edgelist`, `bfs` shipped).
- See [`docs/plans/MASTER_PLAN.md`](docs/plans/MASTER_PLAN.md) and
  [`.codefuse/tracking/ALGORITHMS.md`](.codefuse/tracking/ALGORITHMS.md)
  for the roadmap.
